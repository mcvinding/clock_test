# Clock test
Introspective reports based on a fast rotating clock as made popular by Libet, B., Gleason, C.A., Wright, E.W., & Pearl, D.K. (1983). Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential). *Brain, 106(3)*, 623–642.

This version is written in PsychoPy (http://www.psychopy.org/). It was first written for the study, though a different version was used in the final study:

* Vinding, M.C., Pedersen, M.N., & Overgaard, M. (2013). Unravelling intention: Distal intentions increase the subjective sense of agency. *Consciousness and Cognition, 22(3)*, 810–815. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2013.05.003
* Vinding, M.C., Jensen, M., & Overgaard, M. (2015). The time between intention and action affect the experience of action. *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 9(366).

The script was written 2012-2014 in PsychoPy2. The current version is re-written 2018-2019 for PsychoPy3.
NB. The "letterMode" used in the papers listed above is not working in the current version [2019-02-21].
